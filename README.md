# TribeSat Templates

This repository contains a template for the student payload board in the thinsat. This template is subject to change as new design information is made available. Additionally this template neglects the keep out zones need for the screw holes. These keep out zones will be added when I determine the diameter of the holes.

This repository also contains the library for custom made eagle parts needed in for the project. The data sheets that were used to design these parts can be found in the data_sheets directory.
